![Hero Illustration](docs/hero.png)

Bringing official Solana support to MetaMask. Create accounts, check balances, and use Solana dApps right from your MetaMask wallet. Simple, secure, and seamless.

## Installation

This repository contains the Solana Wallet Snap, which is a plugin for MetaMask. To use it, you'll need to:

1. First, clone and set up the [MetaMask Extension repository](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension)
2. Then install this snap in your local MetaMask extension development environment:

```bash
# In your metamask-extension directory
npm i @metamask/snap-solana-wallet
# or
yarn add @metamask/snap-solana-wallet
```

This dual repository setup allows you to develop and test the Solana Wallet Snap alongside the main MetaMask extension. The snap is installed as a dependency in the MetaMask extension repository, where it can be tested and integrated.
